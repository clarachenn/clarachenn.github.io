            <h2>Hello, I am Clara!</h2>
            <h4>I am a second-year Computer Science student at the University of California, Irvine. 
                My journey in software development began in 9th grade, and since then, I have 
                cultivated a passion for all things related to technology. I am proficient in 
                languages such as Python, Java, C++, HTML, and CSS. As I progress through my studies, 
                I am eager to explore advanced topics, engage in meaningful projects, and continue my 
                growth in the dynamic field of computer science.</h4>

            <h4>In addition to my academic pursuits, I actively engage in a diverse range of 
                extracurricular activities both on and off campus. I serve as a dedicated Academic 
                and Alumni Committee Member at the ICS Student Council, contribute as a Corporate 
                Committee Member for VenusHacks, and participate in Hack at UCI. Furthermore, my 
                commitment extends to projects, and I proudly contribute as a Web Developer for 
                CanSat, combining my technical skills with a passion for innovation. Beyond the 
                realm of technology, I am also a member of the Taekwondo Club at UCI.</h4>
